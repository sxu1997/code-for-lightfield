Matlab script for stacking focal slices
The generation of .mat files was implemented by a MATLAB script. To be more specific, we first read the focal slices (12 focal slices in a scene ordered by the shallowest depth first) and stacked them according to their depth order, then generated a .mat file for each scene.
